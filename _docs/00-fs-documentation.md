Federated Learning (FL) [1,2,3] is a learning paradigm for collaboratively learning models from isolated data without directly sharing privacy information, which helps to satisfy the requirements of privacy protection of the public. FederatedScope (FS), a comprehensive federated learning platform with event-driven architecture, aims to provide easy-to-use and flexible support for users who want to get started and customize task-specific FL procedures quickly.
