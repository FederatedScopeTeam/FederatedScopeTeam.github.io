title: "EasyFGL: Towards a Unified, Comprehensive and Efficient Platform for Federated Graph Learning"
excerpt: "EasyFGL is an easy-to-use python package for federated graph learning. We built it upon FederatedScope so that the requirements for expressing federated graph learning algorithms can be met effortlessly. Benefiting from the comprehensive off-the-shelf datasets, splitters, graph neural network models, etc., we have set up many useful benchmarks for federated graph learning."
